# 🧑‍🎓 UniBuddy University Helpdesk — Future Interns Project

This project was built during my **Future Interns** internship, where the task was to create a **Streamlit-based university helpdesk chatbot platform** for student support, admissions, campus services, and more.

It combines **modern Streamlit web design** and **Dialogflow conversational AI**, helping universities provide instant, user-friendly assistance for students and visitors.

During this internship, I explored the world of **conversational AI** and **edtech**, focusing on building accessible, branded digital helpdesks.
